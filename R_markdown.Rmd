This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
max(cars$dist)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

data1 <- read.table(file = "../output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header=T)

Afghanistan <- subset(data1, country =="Afghanistan")
Algeria <- subset(data1, country =="Algeria")
Albania <- subset(data1, country=="Albania")

par(mfrow = c(1,3))

plot1 <- plot(Afghanistan$year, Afghanistan$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Afghanistan yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Afghanistan$gdpPercap~Afghanistan$year))

plot2 <- plot(Algeria$year, Algeria$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Algeria yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Algeria$gdpPercap~Algeria$year))

plot3 <- plot(Albania$year, Albania$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Albania yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Albania$gdpPercap~Albania$year))

`````
Overtime, Afghanistan resulted in a decrease in GDP while Algeria and Albania had an increase.
