This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
max(cars$dist)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

data1 <- read.table(file = "../output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header=T)

Afghanistan <- subset(data1, country =="Afghanistan")
Algeria <- subset(data1, country =="Algeria")
Albania <- subset(data1, country=="Albania")

par(mfrow = c(1,3))

plot1 <- plot(Afghanistan$year, Afghanistan$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Afghanistan yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Afghanistan$gdpPercap~Afghanistan$year))

plot2 <- plot(Algeria$year, Algeria$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Algeria yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Algeria$gdpPercap~Algeria$year))

plot3 <- plot(Albania$year, Albania$gdpPercap, ylab="gdp per capita", xlab="year", main="Albania yearly GDP")
abline (lm(Albania$gdpPercap~Albania$year))

dev.off()
```
Overtime, Afghanistan resulted in a decrease in GDP while Algeria and Albania had an increase.

```{r}
aggregate(data1$lifeExp, list(data1$continent), mean)
aggregate(data1$lifeExp, list(data1$continent), min)
aggregate(data1$lifeExp, list(data1$continent), max)
```
If you want to live to be an old person, Oceania seems like the best place to live. Theyhave the highest average life expectancy (74.33), the highest minimum life expectancy (69.12), and the third highest maximum life expectancy (81.24).
If you want to try to die before you get old, Africa seems like the place for you. There is the lowest average, minimum, and maximum life expectancy there over the time period studied.

```{r}
dev.off()
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(data1$lifeExp, main="Global Life Expectancy", xlab="default R bin widths")
hist(data1$lifeExp, main="Global Life Expectancy", xlab="narrower bin widths", breaks=50)
dev.off()
```
